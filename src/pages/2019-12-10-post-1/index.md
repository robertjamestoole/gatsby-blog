This is a blog that I am starting for my own use, but I hope that it might help you through similar problems or maybe even get you interested in web development as well. These posts are going to be a compilation of my learnings in the realm of web development which includes everything from learning basic things such as html, css, and javascript all the way up to frameworks and hopefully client projects.

For some context I already know HTML and most of CSS and have been working on learning Javascript for the past couple months. Everything I learn is self taught to some extent with a majority of the lessons coming from Udemy. I study anywhere from 1-3 hrs a day but mostly staying toward the lower end because that's all I currently have time for.

All of the blog posts in this blog are being written up in Markdown and will become more interesting looking with more images and interesting font pieces as I learn more Markdown. The rest of the blog is being posted using Gatsby because I've heard that it's an incredibly fast static site generator which seems to be a great solution for a personal blog that I didn't really want to host on any of the CMS that I tried before.

The blog will be a little more informal and off the cuff with a bit of information on what I am currently learning. This is going to be my main avenue of explaining to myself what I had just learned in todays learning so that I can hopefully better understand what information I just went through. As I said before I hope who ever may read this might find it reassuring or hopefully maybe even helpful. I'm not a teacher though and this is mostly for selfish reasons so while I do hope someone learns something my main goal is to untangle my brain after difficult learning sessions.

I am in the midst of learning Javascript from Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy and it is a very thorough class that takes it slow on most topics with refreshers after primary learning blocks. So far I would recommend the class as it is a ton of knowledge for very little money and Jonas is a very good teacher that takes his time in teaching which I find is a plus as I've taken courses that the teacher's pace ends up being too fast. After I finish this course I am debating diving into learning more React which I know only very little on or doing something like Javascript 30 with Wes Bos that end with 30 built apps to further practical knowledge with Javascript.

This is going to be all for the first post on this blog and I hope to make the blog prettier and the text more interesting in the future but that is not my current goal so it might be some time from now. Thanks for taking the time to read and please have a great day.

Kindest Regards
-Rob
