So where is Waldo?

This iconic game that most people know or at the very least know some form of it in games such as "I spy". I've been thinking about "Where's Waldo" since the beginning of yesterday when I was studying a bit and progressing on a budget app. Now keep in mind this is the first large app of this Javascript course that I am taking. Not that this is my first app of this size but the first where I had some semblance of what I was doing as well as understood the symantics of most of the elements.

With that you're probably still wondering "So, why the hell is this guy thinking of a random game that has nothing to do with web development?". The thing is I love metaphors, I use them all the time to more easily explain things to coworkers, friends, family, and most importantaly myself. I always felt that if someone can relate to something because of a past experience or experience in a different field they will connect with the concept of that thing on a deeper level.

So here we are back at Waldo, standing there in his red striped shirt and goofy face staring back at me. Usually he stands in the middle of a sea of things to distract the would be investigator from his presence. Now imagine that the sea of seemingly random things all came together to form a great picture or piece of art and all you have to do is take a step back and let it come into focus. Here a top it all you can see that this is a fairly coherent picture with trees and cars in place that make it into the comprehensive piece of art that it is. Now of course it only comes together when you take a step back and are able to look at and understand the entirety of it.

Fine, fine i'll get back to Waldo as I know you've missed him. My greater point is that this metaphor is where I find myself. Stuck in a quagmire of confusion when it comes to web development in Javascript. It's like being far sighted up close and near sighted far away. Up close I can see Waldo(a part of this app), with all of the strips neatly on his shirt(all of the methods easy to understand and clear as day), and he sits there next to a small plane, car, or tree(amongst methods and variables). All of this I can see up close and in great clarity, but for some reason when I take that, usually clarifying, step back I am cast into a haze of doubt and confusion as I lose sight of Waldo. It becomes very hard to see how everything in the app can come together into such a well put together piece of art.

Although seeing where the parts of the app connect is my struggle I know I will overcome it with time and practice as with most things. That being said I sometimes sit here after adding a few more functions or arrays and wonder when I'm going to get some glasses.

If you have made it this far thank you for baring with me through this slightly confusing metaphor riddled expos√©. While i truely do find connecting pieces of an app together it too shall pass and I think it will take a few more apps for me to fully understand how to look at the whole of a project. If not and I continue to struggle then so be it and I will have to learn to come to grips with this as I battle on in this career. I'll try to keep the blogs to more technical writtings in the future, but this had been weighing on my mind and is subject related so I felt it still appropriate.

Thanks and Kind regards - R
